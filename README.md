# Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in performing an exploratory data analysis of Stack Overflow survey data from 2013-2018, with a focus on popularity in 2018.

The exercise was a data driven approach to business understanding, with a focus on students or people interested in making a career step.
1. The level of formal education reported by developers?
2. How does the level of formal education relate to reported salaries?
3. How does the level of formal education relate to reported job satisfaction?
4. What are the most popular languages in 2018 and their trends over the past 6 years, including forecasts for 2019?
5. What are the most popular roles in the industry and salary distributions?

This repository contains the data preparation, wrangling and visualisation steps which the blog is based on.

# File Descriptions

This repository contains 2 notebooks which discuss the data in more detail and the CRISP-DM process that was followed. 
1. Salary and Satisfaction in Formal Education - relating to the first 3 questions posed above.
2. Trend Analysis of Programming Languages and Job Roles - relating to the final 2 questions posed above.

Markdown cells were used to explain the process and decisions made throughout the analysis.
